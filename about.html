<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  My name is Jane Chavez, and I am currently a graduate student in Software Engineering at the University of Houston–Clear Lake (UHCL). Before pursuing this degree, I earned both my Associate Degree in Nursing (ADN) and Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN), and I worked as a Registered Nurse for over five years. While I had a rewarding experience in healthcare, I have always felt a strong pull toward the tech field, a passion that began at a young age.

I realized that a career in technology would allow me to explore my creativity in new and exciting ways, and I see it as a path that truly aligns with my interests and long-term goals. I also hope to one day combine my background in nursing with my skills in software engineering to develop innovative solutions that benefit my community—an aspiration that drives me every day.

I am genuinely excited about this career transition and look forward to entering the tech workforce, where I hope to collaborate with like-minded individuals and make a meaningful impact.
